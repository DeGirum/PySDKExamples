    "Welcome to the DeGirum PySDK Quickstart Colab! This notebook is designed to help you get started with PySDK right away, without the need to set up tools or dependencies on your local machine. While the Colab environment may not provide the full range of PySDK’s functionality, the included examples will give you a solid understanding of its capabilities. If you’d like to explore the complete features and unlock the full potential of PySDK, we encourage you to install it on your own machine. Let’s get started by installing the `degirum` and `degirum_tools` packages!"

    "### Running Your First Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we’ll demonstrate how to use PySDK to perform object detection on an example image using a cloud-hosted AI model. Here’s what the code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Required Libraries**: The `degirum` package is used for loading and using AI models, and `degirum_tools` provides utility functions such as obtaining a token and displaying results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load the Object Detection Model**: The `degirum.load_model()` method loads a pre-trained YOLOv8 object detection model hosted in the DeGirum cloud. The key parameters here are:\n",
    "   - `model_name`: Specifies the AI model to use.\n",
    "   - `inference_host_address`: Indicates where inference will be performed. Setting it to `\"@cloud\"` connects the request to DeGirum’s cloud-hosted hardware, leveraging powerful compute resources without requiring local setup. For on-premise or local deployments, this value can be replaced with the IP address or hostname of the target device.\n",
    "   - `zoo_url`: Defines the location of the model zoo, a repository of pre-trained AI models. In this example, it is set to `'degirum/models_hailort'`, specifying a cloud-hosted model zoo managed by DeGirum. The `zoo_url` format typically follows `<organization>/<model_zoo_name>` and can be customized for private repositories.\n",
    "   - `token`: Authenticates your access to the cloud-hosted resources, retrieved here using `degirum_tools.get_token()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run Inference on an Image**: The model processes an example image (a URL pointing to an example image) and generates detection results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Display the Results**: The numeric results of the inference, including detected bounding boxes and class IDs, are printed to the console. Additionally, using `degirum_tools.Display`, the inference results are visualized with object overlays on the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this code, you should see hardware hosted on the cloud run an object classification model, identify detected objects, and show bounding boxes for those detected objects with only a few lines of code."

The JSON configuration provided in the code below enables you to select the hardware you want to use for the AI task you want to perform. We assign a model zoo URL as well as the model names from the DeGirum AI Hub for each AI task. Our approach abstracts hardware-specific complexities, driving a consistent experience for diverse AI tasks. \n",
